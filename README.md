# Supplementary Data and Code for Ecological Niche Models and Linear Regressions of Cerberus in the Philippines. 
Supplemental data and code for niche models and linear regressions of Cerberus (dog-faced water snakes). Manuscript currently in revision.


## Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM)
* Code and input data (except for bioclim layers) to run ENMs can be found at:
